    <h3>Ingredients: For the base:
        300g strong bread flour,
        1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub),
        1 tsp salt,
        1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling,
        For the tomato sauce:
        100ml passata,
        handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried,
        1 garlic clove, crushed,
        For the topping,
        125g ball mozzarella, sliced,
        handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative),
        handful of cherry tomatoes, halved,
        To finish,
        handful of basil leaves (optional)</h3>

        <h3><li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li></h3>
        <h3><li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li></h3>
        <h3><li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li></h3>
        <h3><li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li></h3>
        <h1>Enjoy!</h1>
