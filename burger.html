    <h3>Ingredients: Â½ tbsp olive oil,
        1 onion, peeled and finely chopped,
        1 x 500g pack British Beef Steak Mince 15% fat,
        1 tsp mixed dried herbs,
        1 egg, beaten,
        4 slices mature Cheddar (optional),
        4 white rolls,

        <h3><li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until softened and starting to turn golden. Set aside.</li></h3>
        <h3><li>In a bowl, combine the beef mince with the herbs and the egg. Season, add the onions and mix well. Using your hands, shape into 4 patties.</li></h3>
        <h3><li>Cook the burgers on a preheated barbecue or griddle for 5-6 minutes on each side. While the second side is cooking, lay a slice of cheese on top to melt slightly (if using).
        </li></h3>
        <h3><li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the cut-sides of the buns on the barbecue. Fill with the lettuce, burgers and tomato slices. Serve with ketchup, if you like.
        </li></h3>
